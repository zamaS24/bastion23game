### 4. Unity Project Setup
After opening the project in Unity, Unity might need some time to import and process assets. This is common, especially if it's the first time you're opening the project on a new machine.

### 5. Resolve Dependencies

### 6. Build the Project
In Unity, go to `File > Build Settings`. Select the target platform (in this case, probably Windows) and click "Build." Choose a folder where you want to build the game, and Unity will generate the necessary executable and related files.

### 7. Run the Executable
Navigate to the folder where you built the game, and you should find an executable file (usually ending with `.exe`). Double-click on this file to run your game.

### 8. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors during the build process or when running the executable, check the Unity console for error messages. Resolve any issues based on the error messages.
